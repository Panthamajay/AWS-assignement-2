
1.set up passwordless ssh connection using ssh keypair with which

 we can automate the process of passwordless ssh connection between two AWS ec2 instances

2.let the two ec2 instances to set up passwordless SSH be

    ec2 instances, source server - 34.212.218.170 
 
     destination server 54.186.42.93  

3.Genereated a pair of public and private key using

        ssh-keygen –t rsa
  
 
 pub key has been saved as “id_rsa.pub” and private key saved as “id_rsa”.


4.copied the public key in source to destination in a file named authorized_key

    in the path /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys in 54.186.42.93 .
    
    The commands used are
    
    $ mkdir .ssh
    $ cd .ssh
    $ vi authorized_keys
    $ cd .ssh/


5.checked the key(authorized keys) /file(.ssh) permissions in both source and destination 
   
   Set the permissions
       700(rwx--) to .ssh folder and
       600(rw--)for authorized_keys file in ssh folder

       using commands 
                          chmod 700 .ssh/
                          chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
 
6.connected to the destination from source using the private key of the key pair.

 run ssh username@destination. By default, ssh will pick the ‘id_rsa” private key file located in .ssh folder

7.after correcting the permissions,connection got established
